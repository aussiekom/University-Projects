### Final Project 

**The Scooter Demand Prediction App** uses machine learning and weather forecasting to provide insights into scooter demand across multiple cities. 

The predictive model, based on regression analysis, estimates scooter demand using temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and time-related factors. The interactive interface allows users to explore scooter predictions on an intuitive leaflet map, view temperature trends, and analyze the impact of humidity on scooter demand through insightful charts. This app is a valuable tool for urban planners and scooter-sharing services to optimize fleet management based on weather conditions.

**This project was done using the next technologies:**
* R Shiny - to create a web application
* Leaflet - to insert the interactive map
* [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/) - for interactive plots and graphs
* API requests from the OpenWeatherMap
* Regression Analysis
* Data was downloaded from [here](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities), then sorted to select Europe countries and cities
